Players with positive influence uplift their teammates, foster confidence, and create a winning mentality. Their ability to lead by example and inspire collective effort makes them indispensable to a team's success both on and off the field.</p>

                      <p>
                        He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. His ability to lead his team and control the ball was unlike anything seen before. Early in his career, he was an exceptional dribbler until he developed tendinosis, a tendon injury that affects strength and range of motion, particularly in his knee. Rather than taking the year-long break needed for full recovery, he returned while only partially healed, which permanently affected his dribbling ability. Despite this setback, he adapted by developing a new playstyle and, with a stronger Real Madrid team and his leadership, achieved even greater success.

                        Messi faced many challenges growing up, but his true influence on the game lies in how he revolutionized dribbling and positioning. His ability to get past defenders and his unique approach to the game changed how people view player roles. A study revealed that Messi walked during 80% of his games, showcasing his efficiency in saving energy and running only when necessary. While most players are taught to stay in constant motion, Messi's approach was different—he scanned the field continuously, allowing him to read the game and position himself strategically without unnecessary movement.</p>

                        One player who isn’t recognized enough is the first of African descent to play for the English national team. His contribution had a profound influence on the game, paving the way for greater diversity. Today, 114 players of BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) backgrounds have represented England at the national level. Without his breakthrough, it’s uncertain how much longer it would have taken for others to take the risk and represent the team they felt they belonged to.</p>

                      <p>
                        Beckenbauer is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of all time, known for revolutionizing his position. As ESPN aptly put it, “He wasn’t the first sweeper, nor the first central defender who could play a pass and step into the midfield, but nobody did it as effectively and on such a big stage (arguably, before or after).” Many described his style as "floating" in the midfield, seamlessly transitioning between defense and attack. He introduced a new and influential style of play that changed how the role of a defender was perceived in the game.</p>

                        Very few players have moves named after them, and even fewer achieve lasting recognition for it. The Cruyff Turn, one of the simplest yet most effective moves in soccer, is an exception. It's so straightforward that it's taught to beginners but remains effective enough for professionals to use. Johan Cruyff, the legendary player who perfected this move in the 1970s, left an enduring legacy. Although he hasn’t played in over 30 years, both his name and the iconic move he developed remain relevant and will continue to inspire future generations.</p>

                      <p>
                        Maradona amazed the world with his dribbling, effortlessly gliding past defenders. He also created controversy with the infamous "Hand of God" goal during the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals. Unable to reach the ball with his head, he used his hand to knock it over the goalkeeper and into the net. Despite the referees missing the foul, the goal helped Argentina win 2-1 and ultimately secure the World Cup, cementing Maradona's legacy.

                        Off the field, Maradona struggled with cocaine and alcohol addiction, beginning in 1982 during his time at Barcelona. His addiction worsened in Napoli, where he had ties to the Italian mafia. In 1991, he received a 15-month ban for cocaine use and was later arrested for possessing 0.5 kilograms of cocaine. His troubles continued in 1994 when he was banned from the World Cup after testing positive for ephedrine. He returned briefly to play in Argentina but ended his career after failing another drug test, marking his third in a decade. Despite his brilliance, his legacy remains complicated by his personal struggles.</p>

                      <p>
                        Manuel Neuer is an inspiration to soccer players worldwide. Late in his career, he underwent surgery for skin cancer, a challenge that might have led many to retire, especially given his remarkable achievements. However, Neuer persevered and continues to play for Bayern Munich, a club he has represented for most of his career.

                        Neuer revolutionized the role of a goalkeeper, raising the standards significantly. He excelled at defending outside the box and showcased exceptional confidence in his technical ability with both feet. Even under pressure from attackers, he often remained composed, turning the situation into an opportunity to outplay and embarrass them.</p>

                        Jamie Vardy's story gave hope to players in England’s lower leagues. His rise to Premier League stardom was nothing short of a fairytale, epitomized by Leicester City's historic title win. With odds of 5000-1, the team defied expectations and broke records. Vardy led the charge, setting the record for scoring in 11 consecutive Premier League games, while Riyad Mahrez became the first Algerian and African player to win the PFA Player of the Year award.</p>
