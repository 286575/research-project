                He grew up in a family of devoted Manchester United fans, with two sisters, in a modest household that was not financially well-off. Despite their struggles, the entire family shared a dream of seeing him play for Manchester United one day. At the age of 11, he won the prestigious Bobby Charlton Soccer School National Skills competition, a moment that changed his life. His exceptional performance caught the attention of Manchester United scouts, who invited him to try out for their youth league. By the time he was 16, he had already left home to pursue his soccer dreams, and at just 18 years old, he was proudly playing for Manchester United’s professional team, fulfilling both his and his family's lifelong dream.

                Ronaldo grew up in a family burdened with financial struggles, which made it difficult for him to even play the sport he loved. However, his determination to pursue soccer was stronger than any obstacle he faced. As a child, he had to sweep the streets to help his family make ends meet. At the age of 15, he underwent surgery to treat a heart condition that could have ended his career before it began. Even after achieving wealth that allowed him to retire his parents for the rest of their lives, Ronaldo continued to face heartbreaking challenges. In 2005, when he was just 20 years old, his father passed away from liver failure. Years later, tragedy struck again when one of his twins died during childbirth, adding to the emotional toll he has had to endure throughout his life.

                Dele Alli might be one of the most troubled people in the world of football, but just recently he came out with his struggling mental health. He says that at 6 he was sexually abused, 7 he was smoking, 8 he started dealing drugs, and at 11 he was hung off a bridge by a man from the next estate. All these things still probably haunt him today, as he wasn’t just dealing drugs he was also taking them. At some point in his soccer career, he was addicted to sleeping pills. This is stuff no person should go through. This shows how much drive and talent he must’ve had to make it into the Premier League with these troubles.

              <p>
                Lionel Messi is widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time, known for his extraordinary skills and unmatched ability on the field, despite being shorter than most of his peers. His stature, however, has never been a hindrance to his success. In fact, his low center of gravity has often been credited with giving him remarkable balance and agility, allowing him to maneuver past defenders with ease.  
                    
                What many may not know is that Messi’s height was shaped by a medical condition he faced as a child. At the age of 11, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, which left him physically smaller than other children his age. To manage this condition, Messi had to undergo daily injections of growth hormones. The treatment was expensive, and his family initially struggled to cover the cost. However, when Messi joined FC Barcelona’s famed youth academy, La Masia, at the age of 13, the club stepped in to support him, covering his medical expenses.  
                
                Messi’s journey from a boy with a medical condition to a global soccer icon is a testament to his resilience, determination, and unparalleled talent. Beyond his achievements on the field, Messi inspires millions as a symbol of overcoming adversity to achieve greatness.
